;; nbb smoke test — proves the :cljs branch is real.
;;
;; This library has one reader conditional, in `form-encode`: :clj uses
;; java.net.URLEncoder and :cljs uses encodeURIComponent. Those two do NOT agree
;; by default — URLEncoder is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which encodes a
;; space as `+` and escapes `~`, while encodeURIComponent is RFC 3986 and leaves
;; `~` alone. A request URL that differs between hosts is a request a Wallet may
;; parse differently depending on which host built it, so the disagreement is
;; asserted here rather than assumed away.
