  "OpenID for Verifiable Presentations 1.0 — the Verifier side of the exchange.

   A Verifier asks a Wallet for presentations by sending an Authorization Request
   and validating the Authorization Response that comes back. This namespace
   builds the request, states the invariants the spec puts on it, and validates
   the response envelope.

   ## Why the Verifier side, and only it

   The Wallet side needs a holder key that can sign a presentation over a
   Verifier-supplied nonce. A WebAuthn Passkey cannot: it signs its own
   `authenticatorData || clientDataHash` and nothing else, so it cannot produce a
   key-binding proof over bytes a Verifier chose. An implementation that pretended
   otherwise would be the interesting half missing. The Verifier side has no such
   problem and is complete here.

   ## The one invariant worth reading twice

   §5.3: when a presentation carries no key binding, the `nonce` is NOT echoed in
   the response — there is no proof to bind it into. Session binding then rests
   entirely on `state`, which becomes REQUIRED and must carry at least 128 bits of
   entropy, be fresh per request, be stored in the session, and be checked on the
   way back. `authorization-request` therefore refuses to build a request that
   expects unbound presentations without a `state`, because such a response is
   replayable by anyone who observes it once and nothing downstream could tell.

   ## What this deliberately does not do

   `validate-response` checks the response ENVELOPE — `state` against the session,
   `vp_token` presence — and hands back the raw `vp_token`. It does not walk inside
   it, and does not match returned credentials against the DCQL query.

   That is a boundary, not an oversight: the normative text defining how
   `vp_token` is keyed when `dcql_query` was used could not be retrieved from the
   published specification while this was written, and guessing at the internal
   shape of a structure whose contents gate an authorization decision is worse
   than declining to. Callers must match claims themselves and MUST NOT read a
   successful `validate-response` as \"the Wallet answered the query\".
